# For example, if the class were Spaceship, then attributes might be:

# name

# kind

# speed

# tractor_beam

# These attributes could be accessed by typing:

# Spaceship.name

# Spaceship.kind

# Spaceship.speed

# Spaceship.tractor_beam 

# Notice that these characteristics are accessed using only a dot. 

# On the other hand, methods of the Spaceship class might be:

# warp()

# tractor() 

# These methods could be used by typing:

# Spaceship.warp() 

# Spaceship.tractor()

# Notice that methods are followed by parentheses, and itâ€™s possible for them to take arguments. For example, Spaceship.warp(7) could change the speed of the ship to warp seven.
